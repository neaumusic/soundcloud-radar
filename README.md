Finds people who have reposted specific tracks

TLDR it's amazing to find people on the internet who know the same music

Adds an "Aggregate" button on tracks to accumulate people who reposted them (200 at a time, don't abuse..)

Console will log a "leaderboard" by most common reposters

Highly based on "sc2mp3" code
