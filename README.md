Finds people who have reposted specific tracks. Way better than Spotify radio: more customizable, and with endless possibilities

TLDR it's amazing to find people on the internet who know the same music

Adds an "Aggregate" button on tracks to accumulate people who reposted them (200 at a time, don't abuse..)

Install

Download the source code (green button) and use Chrome "Load Unpacked" to target the folder

I'll work on getting it published to the Chrome Web Store

Highly based on "sc2mp3" code
